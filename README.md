## Main Idea

The project represents a product listing page of an e-commerce store for sports goods, specifically CrossFit.

The layout was chosen to be basic, intuitive, and user-friendly on different devices.

The chosen color theme is easy to read and the colors implemented act as an effect and a way to differentiate the various blocks of content

## On the code side of things 


The data for the products come from a local .JSON file which contains the needed parameters for each product and it's used to render the product cards as well as to make the categorization possible.

On the left side of the page, you can find a sidebar, which opens when pressing the filter button, and that way you can filter the items. It's initially hidden and the idea behind is to achieve more of a minimalistic design of the page and the main focus of the user to be on the products.

The styling is used TailwindCSS and the products page is used grid configuration with ```display:grid``` and the app is responsive on mobile as well. As specified in the task, the header is sticky.



## Challenges

As in every task or project, there were some challenges. The challenges in the task were not many, but they were not lacking, even if they were few.

Some of them were related to the filtering of the products and others to thinking about the whole layout of the app but from that, I learned new things which I'm sure will be valuable in the future.
